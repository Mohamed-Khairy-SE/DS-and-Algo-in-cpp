# What is a Hash Function?
A **hash function** is a function that converts a given large number (such as a phone number) into a smaller, practical integer value. This mapped integer value is used as an index in a hash table. In simple terms, a hash function maps a large number or string to a small integer that can be used as the index in the hash table.

## What is Meant by a Good Hash Function?
A good hash function should have the following properties:

- **Efficiently Computable**: The function should be fast to compute.
- **Uniform Distribution of Keys**: The hash function should distribute the keys evenly across the hash table (each table position should be equally likely for each key).

For example, for phone numbers, a bad hash function would be to take the first three digits, while a better hash function would use the last three digits. However, this may not always be the best approach. There may be other more efficient ways to design a hash function.

## Rules for Choosing a Good Hash Function
- **Simplicity**: The hash function should be simple to compute.
- **Minimize Collisions**: The number of collisions should be minimized when placing a record in the hash table. Ideally, no collision should occur, which would make it a perfect hash function.
- **Uniform Distribution**: The hash function should produce keys that get distributed uniformly over the hash table.
- **Consider All Bits of the Key**: The hash function should depend on every bit of the key. A function that extracts only a portion of the key is not suitable.

In practice, heuristic techniques can often be employed to create a hash function that performs well. Information about the distribution of the keys may be helpful in designing the function. A good hash function should depend on every single bit of the key to ensure that small changes (even a single bit difference) lead to different hash values.

If two keys differ in just one bit, or if they are permutations of each other (such as `139` and `319`), they should hash to different values.

## Heuristic Methods for Hashing
### 1. Hashing by Division
In this method, we map a key to one of the slots of a hash table by taking the remainder when dividing the key by the table size. The hash function can be represented as:

```
h(key) = key % table_size
```

Since division is computationally fast, hashing by division is quite efficient. However, some values of `table_size` should be avoided. For example, if `table_size` is a power of a number (e.g., `2^k`), then the hash function may not distribute the keys evenly.

**Example:** Suppose the key `37599` is mapped using a table size of `17`:

```
h(37599) = 37599 % 17 = 12
```

However, for key `573`:

```
h(573) = 573 % 17 = 12
```

This leads to a **collision** because both keys are mapped to the same hash value. To avoid this, the table size should ideally be a **prime number**, and it should not be close to an exact power of 2.

### 2. The Multiplication Method
In the **multiplication method**, we multiply the key `k` by a constant real number `c` in the range `0 < c < 1`, and then extract the fractional part of the result. We then multiply this value by the table size `m` and take the floor of the result. The hash function is given by:

```
h(k) = floor(m * (k * c mod 1))
```

Alternatively, this can also be written as:

```
h(k) = floor(m * frac(k * c))
```

where `floor(x)` is the integer part of `x`, and `frac(x)` is the fractional part of `x` (i.e., `frac(x) = x - floor(x)`).

An advantage of the multiplication method is that the value of `m` is not critical. Itâ€™s typically chosen as a **power of 2** (e.g., `m = 2^p`) for simplicity, as this is easy to implement on most computers.

The constant `c` is often chosen to be the fraction:

```
(sqrt(5) - 1) / 2 = 0.618033988...
```

because this value works reasonably well.

**Example:** Suppose `k = 123456`, `m = 2^14 = 16384`, and `w = 32` (where `w` is the word size of the machine). Then we calculate:

```
key * s = 327706022297664 = (76300 * 2^32) + 17612864
```

```
r1 = 76300, r0 = 17612864
```

The 14 most significant bits of `r0` yield the hash value:

```
h(key) = 67
